NEURON mod files from the paper:

Miceli et al, Neutralization of a unique, negatively-charged residue
in the voltage sensor of K(V)7.2 subunits in a sporadic case of benign
familial neonatal seizures, Neurobiol Dis., ePub before print (2009)

In this paper, the model revealed that the gating changes introduced
by a mutation in K(v)7.2 genes encoding for the neuronal KM current in
a case of benign familial neonatal seizures, increased cell firing
frequency, thereby triggering the neuronal hyperexcitability which
underlies the observed neonatal epileptic condition.  The fig6a.hoc
reproduces the traces shown in Fig.6a of the paper.

Under linux/unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui fig6a.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the "mknrndll" command.
A double click on the simulation file
fig6a.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Under MAC OS X:
to compile the mod files drag and drop the extracted folder onto the
mknrndll icon. Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui
icon.

Once the simulation is started you can press the run button.  Then
when done click on the mutant box.  Click on the graphs upper left
pull down menu box and select "Keep lines".  Finally, press the run
button again and you should get a graph that combines the black and
red traces of Fig. 6a and looks something like:
